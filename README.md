# 🌿 AI Plant Doctor – Crop Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## 🔍 Problem
Millions of farmers lose crops every year due to late detection of plant diseases. This directly affects food supply, income, and the fight against hunger.

## 🎯 Solution
**AI Plant Doctor** is a deep learning–powered tool that detects diseases from leaf images using a trained convolutional neural network. It provides quick diagnosis and treatment tips — all from a simple web interface.

## 🌐 SDG Focus: **UN SDG 2 – Zero Hunger**

- **Target 2.3**: Double the productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through technology.
- **Target 2.2**: End malnutrition by improving food systems and crop health.

This project empowers small-scale farmers with AI tools to **reduce loss**, **increase food quality**, and **boost yield** through early disease detection.
